Improvements
Query processing: case normalization (lowercasing), stemming using Porter Stemmer, tokenization with NLTK, duplicate detection via MD5 hashing
Content weighting: title text (5x), headings (3x), bold text (2x), body text (1x)
Ranking logic: TF-IDF scoring, document intersection for multi-term queries, weighted term frequencies, partial index merging for large datasets
Content processing: HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup, script and style tag removal, text extraction from multiple HTML elements, special character handling
